        The choice of players is a crucial factor. Make a wise choice for your
        star player, as they will double your point total. Prior to player
        selection, be sure to take the players' current form into account. Since
        you can only choose a certain number of players for each position, use
        the credits wisely to distribute them among the field positions.
