        While fantasy football has yet to reach the same level of popularity in
        India as fantasy cricket, it is gaining ground thanks to the country's
        fervent support of a number of major international football leagues. The
        English Premier League, the Spanish La Liga, the Italian Serie A, and
        the German Bundesliga are some of the most watched football leagues in
        the world. Many Indian sports fans have taken up following the English
        Premier League with renewed fervor since Manchester United and Arsenal
        both established themselves in the league. Currently, everyone can play
        fantasy football without paying a dime. Plus, there's a chance for you
        to win cash prizes. The only Indian states where fantasy cricket and
        fantasy football are illegal are Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Sikkim,
        Nagaland, and Telangana.
